"""Perfroms redirection
HOW IT WORKS:
A user accesses a short URL like ezyurl.com/shortlink in their web browser
Nginx Receives the Request
Nginx Routes the Request to Python Script
Nginx is configured to route all incoming requests to a specific location
Nginx sends the request to this Python script for processing.
The URL path, /shortlink is passed as part of the request to the Python script
The script looks up the original URL associated with shortlink from database
If it finds a matching original URL, it creates a redirection response.
it generates an HTTP redirection response using a 302 status code.
Nginx receives the HTTP redirection response from the Python script.
Nginx processes the redirection response and performs the redirection
based on the Location header. It tells the user's web browser to navigate
to the original URL.
