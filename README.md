## Risks

What are the risks of using Ezy?

####  technical risks

- ``Service Reliability``: Our services can experience downtime. If a service goes offline, all the shortened links associated with it may become inaccessible.
    - ``What we're doing to solve this``? We've decided to keep backups of all services that allows Ezy to keep running to make it better and more reliable.

- ``Loss of Context``: Ezy links may not provide any context about the destination, making it challenging for users to decide whether to click on them.
    - ``What we're doing to solve this``? We make sure to check if a link is secured before processing requests, we do this by checking the ssl certificate of your link, if it's not secured we'd let you know
 
#### non-technical risks

- ``User Experience``: Most times shortened links aim to simplify URLs, they can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration if users cannot discern the destination easily
    - ``What are we doing to solve this``? We allow customised links making it easy to remember (This service will be available soon)
