## Ezy_URLshortner

This project outlines the development of a URL shortener web application, that takes user input (a long URL), generates a shortened version of it, stores relevant data in a database and file storage system, and displays the results to the user.

## Objectives of the project are:
* URL Shortener Functionality: Create a web application that allows users to input a URL and click a button to shorten it. The application will generate a unique, shortened URL.
* User Interface: Develop a homepage with an input field for users to input a URL and a button to initiate the URL shortening process.
* Database and File Storage: Implement a database and file storage system to store the following information for each URL:
  - The original URL provided by the user.
  - The shortened URL generated by the application.
  - The date when the URL was added.
  - A unique identifier for each URL.
* Data Storage Requirements: Save the user-provided URL, the shortened URL, the date of URL addition, and a unique ID associated with each data entry.
* Display of Results: Display the results, including the original URL and the corresponding shortened URL, in the background of the application.
