## Technologies
* Python -
* Javascript
* Html
* Css
* Mysql
* Flask

## Technology Choices
* Database Management: We chose MySQL for its robustness and reliability over alternatives like PostgreSQL. While both are excellent choices, MySQL aligns better with our project's scalability needs.
* Frontend Framework: Initially, we considered React and Vue.js for the frontend. We decided on plain JavaScript for a lightweight and fast user experience, allowing us to cater to a wider audience without sacrificing performance.


## Challenge
### Problem Statement
EzyURL Shortener addresses the issue of cumbersome and lengthy URLs, making online communication more efficient by transforming them into concise, easy-to-share links.

### What EzyURL Shortener Does Not Solve
* Offline Usage: EzyURL Shortener relies on an active internet connection and won't work in scenarios with limited or no internet access.
* Longevity: EzyURL is designed with a limited lifespan in mind. It may not be suitable for content that needs to remain accessible indefinitely.



## Risks
####  technical risks

- ``Service Reliability``: Our services can experience downtime. If a service goes offline, all the shortened links associated with it may become inaccessible.
    - ``What we're doing to solve this``? We've decided to keep backups of all services that allows Ezy to keep running to make it better and more reliable.

- ``Loss of Context``: Ezy links may not provide any context about the destination, making it challenging for users to decide whether to click on them.
    - ``What we're doing to solve this``? We make sure to check if a link is secured before processing requests, we do this by checking the ssl certificate of your link, if it's not secured we'd let you know
 
#### non-technical risks

- ``User Experience``: Most times shortened links aim to simplify URLs, they can sometimes lead to confusion or frustration if users cannot discern the destination easily
    - ``What are we doing to solve this``? We allow customised links making it easy to remember (This service will be available soon)
 
## Infrastructure
### Version Control
We use the GitHub flow for branching and merging in our team's repository. This workflow ensures that changes are well-documented and reviewed before merging into the main branch.

### Deployment Strategy
We deploy our project using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the deployment process, ensuring smooth and efficient releases.

### Data Population
We populate our app with data using automated scripts and user-generated content. The data is stored securely in our MySQL database.

### Testing
We employ a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Automated testing tools and manual testing ensure the reliability and functionality of our application
